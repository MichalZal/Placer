# Placer
## This is an application made in MERN stack. ``` MongoDB ```, ``` Express ```, ``` React ``` and ``` NodeJS ```. 
### In this app you have full CRUD. You can manage places for meetings. It fetches them from Mongo, and displays in React. 

### In this project I learned how applications in MERN stack accually works. I also trained my skills in React, like creating custom hooks, context API, react-router-dom and react ecosystem knowledge.   

### Fullstack development is fun, but I want to focus on frontend mainly and only know core concepts of backend for future work. Nobody hires Junior fullstack developer.
