# Placer
## This is an application made in MERN stack. ``` MongoDB ```, ``` Express ```, ``` React ``` and ``` NodeJS ```. 
### In this app you have full CRUD. You can manage places for meetings. It fetches them from Mongo, and displays in React. 

### Other packages use:
``` -React Router Dom ``` for managing the pages.
``` -react-transition-group ``` for transitions.
``` -Sass ``` for better css.
``` -express-validator ``` for validating requests.
``` -mongoose ``` for connection with mongodb.
``` -multer ``` for file upload.

### In this project I learned how applications in MERN stack accually works. I also trained my skills in React, like creating custom hooks, context API, react-router-dom and react ecosystem knowledge.   

### In this project I didn't use Typescript because I wanted to focus on learning this stack. But after finish I will upgrade It, because Typescript is the best.
